# akka-typed-chat

[Akka Typed](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/actors.html#actors) is a new type-safe way to implement the Actor Model. 

This is a modification of the [Chat Example](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/actors.html#a-more-complex-example) from the documentation.

I placed each actor in its own file and changed the main program to attach two clients rather than one. 
Also renamed a few things.
